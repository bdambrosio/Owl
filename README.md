# Sam
Sam is my experimental Research Coach / general support.
Sam is built on Alphawave-py / promptrix, both heavily modded. Modded Alphawave-py is included, but promptrix-py isn't, I'll fix that before release.

So why yet another bot? Well, Sam is a personal research project into cognitive architecture. 
* Of course Sam can do obvious stuff like search the web or wikipedia or retrieve articles from the new york times or ...
* Of course Sam manages conversational context
* Sam also has an active working memory it can do semantic retrieval from
    ** and full CRUD
    ** and create knowledge graphs over
* Sam can also create hierarchical plan structures
* Sam can resolve the tasks in those plans to subplans or, at the fixed point, into a set of primitive text manipulation operations.
    ** This latter is, imho, the most interesting part.
