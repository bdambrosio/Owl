# Owl
Owl is my experimental Research Coach / general support.
Owl is built on Alphawave-py / promptrix-py, both heavily modded. Modded Alphawave-py is included, but promptrix-py isn't, I'll fix that before release.

So why yet another bot? Well, Owl is a personal research project into cognitive architecture. 
* Of course Owl can do obvious stuff like search the web or wikipedia or retrieve articles from the new york times or ...
* Of course Owl manages conversational context
* Owl also has an active working memory it can do semantic retrieval from
    ** and full CRUD
    ** and create knowledge graphs over
* Owl builds a separate RAG of embedded memories of research papers retrieved from ARXIV and Semantic Scholar
* Owl can also create hierarchical plan structures
* Owl can resolve the tasks in those plans to subplans rooted at a set of text operations performed by LLM or function call.
* Owl can write extended research reports: query to understand topic, generate outline, search Semantic Scholar, retrieve and index papers, and write and refine a multi-page research report, with references. This process can take quite some time, depending on how Owl is configured, but mostly happens offline while you sleep!
