# Owl
Owl is my experimental Research Coach / general support.
Owl is built on Alphawave-py / promptrix, both heavily modded. Modded Alphawave-py is included, but promptrix-py isn't, I'll fix that before release.

So why yet another bot? Well, Owl is a personal research project into cognitive architecture. 
* Of course Owl can do obvious stuff like search the web or wikipedia or retrieve articles from the new york times or ...
* Of course Owl manages conversational context
* Owl also has an active working memory it can do semantic retrieval from
    ** and full CRUD
    ** and create knowledge graphs over
* Owl builds embedded memories of research papers retrieved from ARXIV and Semantic Scholar
* Owl can also create hierarchical plan structures
* Owl can resolve the tasks in those plans to subplans rooted at a set of text operations performed by LLM or function call.
